This is the first guide in Module 1.
Aim is to create a poster using html and css. 

The backdrop is a wooded scene from movie Totoro. Text with a hover link that opens the theme song in another tab. 
Being a total beginner I wanted to make a super simple mood poster or site as a way to get to know some concepts in html and css.
